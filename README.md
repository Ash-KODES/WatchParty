<h1 align="center">Welcome to WatchPartyðŸ‘‹</h1>

## ðŸ¤” Problem

We sometimes want to connect to our friends and family who might be living far away from us. Watching videos together is one of the best ways to spend time together. So this chrome extension allows people to watch content together with everyone watching the same content on everyone's screen

## âœ¨ Features

- Separated rooms for watch parties
- Chat feature for communicating between the connected users
- Time stamp synchronization with the host across all the connected users in the room
- A Node.js server handles all the users in the room
- Tech Stack : Node.js, JavaScript

All users open a shared link to a YouTube video and then join the room. Please note that the host should click on play/pause button or on the progress bar instead of using keyboard shortcuts.

The video will sync automatically when the host plays/pauses the video or seeks the progress bar of the video
